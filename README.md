# Model_Ensembles_for_Heart_Disease_Classification
Implment five baseline models, including logistic regression, KNN, SVM, decision tree, and random forest. And three ensemble models constructed on the baseline models, where two of them implemented voting scheme (soft and hard voting) and another one is an hybrid combination of multi-layer perceptron (MLP) with the five baseline models.
